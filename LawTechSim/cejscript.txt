*:Emily: Hey, make sure you submit reading responses!

*:Sei: So we’re making a parody video mashup of Don’t Copy that Floppy and Shake it Off...

*:Brad: Go see Sei!
*:Emily: Hey, make sure you submit reading responses!

*:Sei: So if our video constitutes fair use and goes viral, and I start getting ad revenue, is it still fair use?

*:Student: OPTION A: Maybe, depending on if the copyright owner sues and if the judge seeing the case takes a liberal or conservative reading of fair use, since it’s a very grey area...
*:Student: Just wait it out for a duckface Congress, then you’ll be okay.
*:Student: OPTION B: No, because impinging on the copyright owner’s potential market is the biggest factor in determining fair use, duh.
*:Student: OPTION C: Yes, once fair use, always fair use, no matter how much money it make$$$$$$$$$$$.
*:Student: OPTION D: Sorry, I forgot what you said, can you repeat that?

*:Emily: Hey, make sure you submit reading responses!

*:Sei: So if I put "Shake it Off" in the background of "Don’t Copy that Floppy" footage, that’s fair use? And I can claim ownership/profit from it?

*:Student: OPTION A: No, because that’s not very transformative! You need to add effort and utilize your creativity!
*:Student: OPTION B: Sure, mo money, mo problemz, right? That’s how lawyers work!
